# Development-task
Hello, 
This is my submission for the development task. The task is incomplete by the way. I faced some issues which i would like to convey. I was using javascript to fetch api from codeforces but it did not work out.
My api signature was coming as incorrect everytime and I could not figure out why. I tried for long but no solution worked. I can't really understand what is the main problem so I could not develop the logic for it.
I have designed the UI though with responsiveness. I am extremely sorry for the fault. I hope you will be considerate with my problem and if possible help me with the problem in the future.
